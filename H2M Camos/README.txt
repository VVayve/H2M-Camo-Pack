------------------------------------------Q & A ------------------------------------------


Q: Will this get me banned?

A: No, all cod client's support custom camos. Therefore unless you're running an event that prohibits the use of custom camos, you should be fine.


Q: How do I install camos?

A: Please resort to this YouTube video, I explain everything you need to do to install the camos. ---> 


Q: How can I see the camo's without installing them first?

A: The YouTube video here ---> Showcases all the camo's available in this pack.


Q: Will others see my camo's?

A: No, custom camo's on any cod client is what's called "client side" only. Meaning only you and other's that installed the exact same camo can see it.


Q: Some camo's are low quality?

A: Yes, some camos in this pack were taken from screenshots as opposed to ripping them straight from another game. This is on me as I do not own EVERY single Call of Duty and can't be fucked to do so.


Q: Some camo's are WAY too big in the menu..

A: Yes, this is because I can't be bothered to fix them nor do I know the proper name for the icon itself :p (This is a pack with over 200 camo's, give me a break lol)
